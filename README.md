# The Tower!
Welcome to my Python Project, a text based tower dungeon where you defeat enemies to acend floors and eventually reach the top of the tower where you will be crowned champion.

To run the game, use 'python start.py' in your terminal.

Feel free to put on <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6mZIlnYSV0> for some background music.

Notes:
<br>At the moment there isn't really player input past naming your character, the enemied you fight at each level are randomly generated and all the combat is automated. Future expansion would be adding different options in combat for the player to choose from, randomized loot/traps dropped, and mopre floors with a much wider variety of enemies and bosses. Its not scripted persay as enemies are semi-randomised and damage dealt to/by characters is randomized within ranges, but not having more player input means you just sit and watch the scenario play out which is dull.
